## Description

Techie Trends and Truths is a tech blog where users can post content for others to read and comment on.  Once a user is registered and logged in they can create new posts and comment on current posts.  This site is deployed to Heroku. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
